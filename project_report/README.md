Part 2:

The Problem: Our team identified a lack of adequate interface flexibility in Synchro Studio, making it difficult for users to efficiently find tools and customize their workspace.

Design and Approach: To address the issue of limited interface flexibility in Synchro Studio, our team focused on two key areas: tool discoverability and workspace customization. Our design introduces a global search bar at the top of the application (similar to the one in Microsoft Word) to help users quickly locate tools and features. Additionally, we implemented a flexible panel system that allows users to freely resize, reposition, and toggle the visibility of key panels such as the map and data views.
