Part 2:

The Problem: Our team identified a lack of adequate interface flexibility in Synchro Studio, making it difficult for users to efficiently find tools and customize their workspace.

Design and Approach: To address the issue of limited interface flexibility in Synchro Studio, our team focused on two key areas that outlined th is issue: tool discoverability and workspace customization. Our design introduces a global search bar at the top of the application (similar to the one in Microsoft Word) to help users quickly locate tools and features. Additionally, we implemented a flexible panel system that allows users to freely resize, reposition, and toggle the visibility of key panels such as the map and data views.

Tool Search Task: 

Task Context - The Tool Search Task involves implementing a tool search bar at the top of the very top of the screen that users can use to find tools quickly and efficiently. This tool is critical because of its time saving capabilities and the overall quality-of-life it provides to both newer and more experienced users.

Narrative Walkthrough - Similar to Microsoft Word/Excel, at the top of the Synchro Studio application is a visible search bar. The user will click the search bar to begin typing, in which a brief list of recently searched tools will appear. When the user begins typing the beginning letters of a tool, the searchbar will give results of tools that have those letters until the full word is typed out or no other tools match the letters. THe user then has the exact tool they need and can select it from there.


Panel Customization Task:

Task Context - The Panel Customization Task involves implementing a feature that allows the user to customize the size and visibility of any and all panels used in Synchro Studio. This feature is important as way of saving time and energy having to nagivate back and forward between informational panels and the map panel to interact with as well as ensuring a quality-of-life experience.

Narrative Walkthrough - To set up the scenario, we have a Synchro Studio application open with a map panel and a data panel setup in the same application next to eachother. The user has the ability to click and hold at the border of both applications and drag either left or right to increase/decrease the size of either panel to the size of their liking. Furthermore, the user can click and hold the window and drag it to wherever they desire on the screen. They also have the ability to click and hold the corner of the panel and drag inward or outward to increase decrease the size of that individual panel.
