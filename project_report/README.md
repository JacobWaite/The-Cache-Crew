Part 2:

The Problem: Our team identified a lack of adequate interface flexibility in Synchro Studio, making it difficult for users to efficiently find tools and customize their workspace.

Design and Approach: To address the issue of limited interface flexibility in Synchro Studio, our team focused on two key areas that outlined th is issue: tool discoverability and workspace customization. Our design introduces a global search bar at the top of the application (similar to the one in Microsoft Word) to help users quickly locate tools and features. Additionally, we implemented a flexible panel system that allows users to freely resize, reposition, and toggle the visibility of key panels such as the map and data views.

Tool Search Task: 

Task Context - The Tool Search Task involves implementing a tool search bar at the top of the very top of the screen that users can use to find tools quickly and efficiently. This tool is critical because of its time saving capabilities and the overall quality-of-life it provides to both newer and more experienced users.

Narrative Walkthrough - Similar to Microsoft Word/Excel, at the top of the Synchro Studio application is a visible search bar. The user will click the search bar to begin typing, in which a brief list of recently searched tools will appear. When the user begins typing the beginning letters of a tool, the searchbar will give results of tools that have those letters until the full word is typed out or no other tools match the letters. THe user then has the exact tool they need and can select it from there.


Panel Customization Task:

Task Context - The Panel Customization Task involves implementing a feature that allows the user to customize the size and visibility of any and all panels used in Synchro Studio. This feature is important as way of saving time and energy having to nagivate back and forward between informational panels and the map panel to interact with as well as ensuring a quality-of-life experience.

Narrative Walkthrough - To set up the scenario, we have a Synchro Studio application open with a map panel and a data panel setup in the same application next to eachother. The user has the ability to click and hold at the border of both applications and drag either left or right to increase/decrease the size of either panel to the size of their liking. Furthermore, the user can click and hold the window and drag it to wherever they desire on the screen. They also have the ability to click and hold the corner of the panel and drag inward or outward to increase decrease the size of that individual panel.

Design Research Process Summary: Our primary design research rationale involved making the user experience more intuitive to use without severely hindering current functionality in Synchro Studios. Additionally, we wanted to retain the core design principles of Synchro Studios, mainly simplicity. Our user research objectives targeted both new users with TCE 327 students and experienced users with the TCE 327 professor. We initially used a contextual inquiry to observe student participants and the lecturer working in Synchro. Design questions then emerged with interviews for both target audiences. Overall, we wanted to gain a better understanding on what currently adds to Synchro Studios simplicity and what detracts from it.

3 Key Insights: 

Key Insight #1: Learnability

Throughout the design process, a significant insight that influenced our design goals was determining how to further improve the learning experience of Synchro Studios. Initial insights came with observing TCE 327 students learning the software for the first time. This was later clarified with the user review interview with the professor for TCE 327. One of the primary aspects the interviewee emphasized was how intuitive the software was to teach to new students, especially compared to similar applications. Additionally, TCE 327 student interviewees expressed Therefore, our design goals revolved around introducing features that emphasize ease of use and learnability without. The result of this insight for the final design was the inclusion of a search bar and adjustable tabs that even new users likely have experience using.

Key Insight #2: Expectation

Despite being partially outdated, Synchro Studios is widely used due to clients having existing expectations for work from Synchro Studios. This insight emerged with the lecturer mentioning the software’s age while observing TCE 327 students learning during the contextual inquiry session. Further clarification made with user review for the TCE 327 professor who highlighted the benefit of client familiarity with Synchro Studios due to the software’s ease of use. Because of this, our final design needed to not adversely affect the fundamental expectations for both users and clients for Synchro Studios. The search bar targets users through introducing a feature that is familiar. The adjustable tabs allows users to modify their workspace through customizing existing tabs in Synchro Studios, which doesn’t affect the final product clients are familiar with. Both of these features simply add to the user experience without having to change current expectations.

Key Insight #3: Usability

The final insight is usability in which unintuitive functions in Synchro Studios were analyzed. Similar to other insights, our first impressions emerged with the contextual inquiry where both the TCE 327 lecturer and student participants had to constantly flip between the map and lane settings tab. Design questions further answered in the student interview, with the student interviewee noting that a current usability issue is the locking map and lack of a search option for navigating tools. Therefore, the adjustable tabs are designed to have multiple tabs for maps that can be readily adjusted. Additionally, our final design incorporates a search bar to create easier access for different functions in Synchro Studios.



Part 5:

Iterative Design Process Summary: Our iterative design process initially began with a series of low fidelity sketches that conveyed expected user tasks based on prior design research (Figure 1). Based on sketches, our paper prototype was designed to simulate functionality for a search bar and adjustable tabs.  

3 Design Insights: 

Design Insight #1: Avoid Narrowing Functionality

During the paper prototype usability test for the search bar, a significant design insight emerged with the design philosophy behind the search bar. The paper prototype test involved finding a specific tool using only the search bar. Specifically, the usability tester noted the following: “When I use software, I usually use the search bar as a last resort”. Therefore, further iterations with the finalized paper prototype and digital mockups revolve around making the search bar an additional feature rather than one intended to fully replace existing functionality.

Design Insight #2: Efficiency

Another key design insight was learning from the usability tests that certain features that correspond with each other should be combined. Specifically, the initial tab system utilized separate tabs for the map and data (Figure 2). During the usability test, the adjustable tabs participant noted the need to switch between maps and data tabs individually to have the correct tabs displayed at the same time. After this insight, changes were made for the digital mockup to create a general scenario tab that saves layouts for corresponding tabs (Figure 3).
